<h1>Random Mundane Magic Item Generato</h1>

<p>This page provides a set of lists used to generate single-use mundane magical items for your fantasy roleplaying game of choice. You can roll on each list to generate an item at the table or you can print out the <a href="#100items">1d100 magic item list</a> and roll against that. Reloading this page will build a new list of 100 random magic items.

<p>The powers and quirks of these items last about five minutes from the time the item is activated and the items can be used only once. They're intended to add some interesting but not particularly powerful magic items into the hordes of treasure found by PCs.

<p>The descriptions of these items are purposefully vague and include no mechanics. This lets GMs work with players to decide how they actually work and lets them work in just about any fantasy RPG of your choice. If you need further guidance on how these powers work, take a look at the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/indexes/spells.htm">d20 SRD spell descriptions</a> that inspired many of these powers.
